### Energy Levels (electronic, vibrational, rotational, translational)
### Internal Energy
Internal energy is the sum of all the energy of all the particles in the system.
Internal energy is denoted with the symbol U.
When we are referring to internal energy it is important to note that we are alluding to a state function.
State functions or state variables are properties of a system that are determined by the current state of the system rather than the path which the system that got to that state (conveniently these are called path functions).
We can see changes in the internal energy of a system in a couple of ways:
the first (and one that we tend to not think about a lot and ignore) is by changing the number of particles within a system.
The second and third are much more important and are heat (q) and work (w).
Thus we can think about a change in internal energy as the sum of the heat added to and work applied to the system.
While internal energy is a state function,
heat and work are both path dependent.
We will discuss work more thoroughly in another section of this website.
### Enthalpy
For a process where pressure volume work is the only work done on the system the first law of thermodynamics is that change in internal energy is equal to q+w or q minus the integral of PdV from V1 to V2.
Therefore, if we are at a constant volume our change in internal energy is just equal to qv (subscript the v to indicate volume).
We can also do processes at constant pressure whereby change in U is equal to qp (subscript the p to indicate pressure) - PdeltaV which can be arranged to equal qp = deltaU + PdeltaV.
If we define a new state function,
Enthalpy ($H$), as
$$H = U + PV$$
we can see that (by the chain rule in calculus)
$$\Delta H = \Delta U + \Delta (PV) = \Delta U + P \Delta V + V \Delta P $$
where at constant pressure
$$\Delta H = \Delta U + P \Delta V$$.
We can see then that $\Delta H$ is equal to $q_p$.
Therefore at a constant pressure $H$
virtually works the same as U when there is constant volume.
### Entropy
From the first law of thermodynamics we can come up with the idea that energy is conserved and thus the change of energy in the universe (universe being a little abstract in that it is both our system and the surroundings) must be equal to 0. If the change in energy is always equal to 0 how does anything actually occur? For systems that release energy to the surroundings the explanation is relatively intuitive but for systems which absorb energy (moving to higher energy levels) there needs to be some way to explain why this occurs. This is the idea of entropy (S), a state function (we will discuss more this semester as to what entropy actually is). The second law of thermodynamics states that the change in entropy of the universe is equal to the change of entropy of the system and the change in entropy of the surroundings. This change in entropy of the universe must be greater than 0.

One way to think about entropy is through a probability lens. Entropy can be related to the Boltzmann constant where S = klnW where W is equal to n!/(n0!n1!n2!...nj!). Where n is the number of particles in the system. From this definition we can see that entropy will increase when the number of particles in a system increases. If we refer back to the Boltzmann distribution section we can also see that the entropy of the system will increase as the temperature increases.
