### Boltzmann Distribution
Boltzmann Law
$$nj/ni = e^-(Ej-Ei)/kT$$

The most probable distribution will have more particles at the lowest level then at any other level.

Effects of Temperature
As high temperature there are more excited states
At low temperature more particles are at ground state
### Equilibria
### Phase Diagrams
### Kinetics

### Gas Laws
### Energy Levels (electronic, vibrational, rotational, translational)
Electronic energy:
Largest Energy. molecules are normally solids.
Vibrational Energy:
we treat vibrating molecules as anharmonic oscillators (treated like a spring)
bond stretching, bending, etc.
Two forces: Force Constant (Kf) and Reduced Mass (\mu)
reduced mass = (m1 x m2)/(m1 + m2)]
$$Evib = (i + 1/2)^2 (h^2/4π)(1/ud^2)$$
$$d = displacement (length of vibration)$$

Rotational Energy:
Molecules can rotate(like a rigid motor). Generally, only gases and some liquids can rotate.
$$Erot = i(i+1)(h^2/8π^2)(1/uR^2)$$
i = 0, 1, 2....
R= bond length in meters
translational energy:
spaced extremely close together. No force constants in the equations. Molecules normally in the gas phase  
$$Etrans = Enx,ny,nz = (nx^2 + ny^2 + nz^2)(h^2/8)(1/md^2)$$
m = NOT reduced mass (normal mass)
Ground state = 111
First excited state = 211

Multiple energies in one diagram

### Enthalpy  
### Entropy
### Gibbs Free Energy  
### Thermodynamic Laws
## First Law
The first law is:
ΔU = q + w
Change in internal Energy is the heat plus work applied

ΔU is a state function
q + w are not state functions

Work = (force applied) x (distance travelled)
                      or
               w = -PΔV = -nRΔT
Hess's Law:
Change in state from A to B involves more than one step, then the overall change in a state function would be the sum of the changes.
Bond dissociation energery (BDE)
It takes energy to break bonds
ΔrU (Interal Energy) = ∑ BDE (reactants) - ∑ BDE(products)

Stronger bond energy is correlated with a lower ground state
## Second Law  
The second law is:
ΔSuniverse = ΔS + ΔSsurr > 0
### Heat Capacity  
### Endo- vs Exo-thermic Processes
### Work and Force
