To add math text, write the latex for the math you're hoping to see in 
double dollar signs `$$ ... $$` where the dots are math.
This will automatically try to detect if the math should be inline or in display mode (like its own equation).
If you'd like to force one or the other, use
`\\[...\\]` for display math and
`\\(...\\)` for inline math.
