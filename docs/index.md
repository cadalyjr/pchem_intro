## Welcome to the Haverford CHEM304 and CHEM305 Preparation Site! (still under construction)

Physical Chemistry courses can be quite
intimidating for a variety of reasons.
One of those reasons is that there
are skills that are quite useful in Phyiscal Chemistry
that are not so often used in, say, Organic Chemistry.
The goal of this website is to help provide a one-stop-shop
to review and reference material related to those
skills.

We've subdivided the resources on this website
into three different categories: [math](./math.md), [code](./code.md), and [chem](./chem.md).

On the [math](./math.md) page, you'll find
descriptions of the math skills needed for Physical Chemistry as
you may have seen them in Math 118, 121, 215, or 216.
You will also find links to youtube videos or other resources
where you can review and refresh your memory.

On the [code](./code.md) page, you'll find
python and mathematica notebooks containing sample solutions
to a wide variety of book problems from
*Molecular Thermodynamics* by McQuarrie and Simon. You will
also find a pair of introductory notebooks
to help acclimate you to using these coding
languages for your homework.

Finally, on the [chem](./chem.md) page,
you'll find review material meant to remind you
what you learned in Chem 112/114 and
resources to refresh your memory.

Glad to see you on this page, and I'm excited to see you this fall!

This website was developed by the Daly research group at Haverford in Summer 2022.
