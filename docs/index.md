## Welcome to the Haverford CHEM304 and CHEM305 Preperation 52 Site! It's still being built - thanks for your patience!

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/cadalyjr/pchem_intro/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

Here we can find info on the [math](./math.md), [code](./code.md), and [chem](./chem.md).

Here's a [python script](./assets/files/umbrella_setup.py), a [mathematica notebook](./assets/files/3.4\ Phase\ Diagram\ of\ Sulfur.nb'), and a [jupyter notebook](./assets/files/ext_charge_test.ipynb)

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/cadalyjr/pchem_intro/settings/pages). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
