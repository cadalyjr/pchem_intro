# Mathematics Concepts

## Calculus
  1. Limits
      - A limit is denoted by a formula similar to $$\lim_{v \to 0} f(v)$$ where this represents some function where $v$ is approaching 0. 
  2. Diffentiation
      - What are derivatives?
        - A derivative is the instantuous rate of change of a given function. For example: $$\frac{d}{dx}(2x)=2$$ is the derivative of 2x with respect to x, and the answer 2 is the slope/rate of change of 2x at all points on the function. 
        - The formal definition of a derivative is provided through this formula: $$f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$
      - First Derivatives
      - Second Derivatives and Beyond
      - Critical Points
      - Inexact and Exact Differentials
	$\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x} = f'(x)$
  3. Summation
