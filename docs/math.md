## Calculus
<ins>Limits:</ins>

A limit is one of the most important parts of calculus. The idea of a limit sets the foundation of everything in calculus such that every formal definition of a derivative and an integral is defined through a limit. So! What is a limit? A limit looks like this:
$$\lim_{x \to 0} (3x+1)$$
where the function $3x+1$ looks like this:

<p align="center">

</p>

and what our limit is asking is this: as $x$ approaches $0$, what does the function $3x+1$ equal? Basically, if I zoomed in on this graph at $0$, what does the function equal? In this case:

$$\lim_{x \to 0} (3x+1)=1$$

This is the simple idea of a limit, and we use this definition to define the rest of calculus. 

<ins>Diffentiation/Derivative:</ins>

A derivative is the instantaneous rate of change (can be visualized by the line tangent to the graph at a particular point) of a given function. For example: $$\frac{d}{dx}(2x)=2$$ is the derivative of 2x with respect to x, and the answer 2 is the slope/rate of change of 2x at all points on the function.

The formal definition of a derivative is defined from this limit definition: 
$$f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

      - What are derivatives?
        - A derivative is the instantuous rate of change (can be visualized by the line tangent to the graph at a particular point) of a given function. For example: $$\frac{d}{dx}(2x)=2$$ is the derivative of 2x with respect to x, and the answer 2 is the slope/rate of change of 2x at all points on the function. 
        - The formal definition of a derivative is provided through this formula: $$f'(x)=\lim_{\Delta x \to 0} \frac{f(x+\Delta x)-f(x)}{\Delta x}$$

        - Exact differential follows the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus s.t. 
	$\frac{\partial f(x)}{\partial x} = f'(x)$
